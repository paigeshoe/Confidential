# ðŸŽ§ Audio Streaming App with WebRTC, Audio Filters, and Real-time Visualization
This project demonstrates a React-based application that streams audio between two users using WebRTC. It includes real-time audio manipulation (gain and frequency filters) and visualization of the audio stream using the Web Audio API and an HTML canvas.

# ðŸ§ª Approach and Challenges
Approach:
Audio Streaming: WebRTC was used to handle the core requirement of streaming audio between two users. The RTCPeerConnection API manages the connection, and getUserMedia() captures audio from the microphone.

Audio Filters: The Web Audio APIâ€™s GainNode and BiquadFilterNode were employed to manipulate the audio stream. Users can toggle the gain and lowpass filter in real-time while streaming audio.

Real-time Visualization: An AnalyserNode from the Web Audio API extracts frequency data from the audio stream. The data is then drawn as a waveform using an HTML canvas element, with continuous updates to reflect changes in the audio.

Challenges:
WebRTC Setup: Establishing a peer-to-peer connection using WebRTC requires a signaling server to exchange session details between peers. For simplicity, the demo focuses on local and remote streams but doesnâ€™t implement the signaling server.

Audio Context Management: Applying real-time audio filters without disrupting the stream was complex. Managing the Web Audio APIâ€™s audio context to ensure smooth transitions between filtered and unfiltered audio required careful handling.

Efficient Visualization: Rendering real-time visualizations with the canvas required optimizing how frequently the waveform updates to ensure smooth and performant animation.

# ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies
React: Core framework for managing UI components and state.
WebRTC: Used for peer-to-peer audio streaming.
Web Audio API: Applied to manipulate audio filters and visualize audio in real-time.
HTML Canvas: Used for rendering the audio waveform.
CSS (Flexbox): Styling to create a modern, responsive user interface.

# ðŸ§© Project Structure
src/AudioStreamer.js:

Manages WebRTC peer-to-peer audio streaming.
src/AudioFilterController.js:

Implements gain and frequency filters using the Web Audio API.
src/AudioVisualizer.js:

Handles real-time visualization of the audio stream.
src/App.js:

The main component that connects everything together.

# ðŸŽ¨ UI Design
The app uses a clean, minimal design with a responsive layout. Some key UI design choices:

Centered Layout: The main elements (audio player, buttons, and canvas) are centered for clarity and focus.
Buttons: Large, interactive buttons with hover effects for toggling audio filters.
Waveform Visualization: Real-time audio waveform displayed on a canvas, with smooth transitions.
